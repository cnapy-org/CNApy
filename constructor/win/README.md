## Install CNApy with conda

We use conda as package manager to install CNApy. You can use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

1. Create a conda environment with all dependencies
    ```sh
    conda create -n cnapy-1.0.4 -c conda-forge -c cnapy cnapy=1.0.4
    ```

2. Activate the cnapy conda environment
    ```
    conda activate cnapy-1.0.4
    ```

3. Run CNApy
    ```
    cnapy
    ```

**IMPORTANT**: To use the CNA Matlab functions you need atleast Matlab 2019b and the Python API for the Matlab engine installed and of course CNA. Alternatively to Matlab you can also use Octave.

## How to run a script in the CNApy terminal

A toy example is included in this repository [here](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy/blob/master/testscript.py).
You can execute the script from the CNApy console like this.

```python
import testscript
testscript.run(cna)
```
